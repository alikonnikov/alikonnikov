Currently working in Japan and transitioning backend expertise from PHP to Java.

### 🔧 Tech Focus

### 🚀 Featured Project
My Daily Quest — personal web application for gamifying daily tasks within small groups (alpha version)
🔗 https://my-daily-quest.com

A platform where a host can create a private group and assign daily tasks to participants.
Users earn points for completing tasks, which can later be exchanged for rewards defined by the host.

Example use case:
A family uses the platform to gamify household responsibilities — parents create tasks for children (cleaning, homework, shopping), assign point values, and set rewards such as movie nights or gifts.

Technical highlights:

Backend built with Java 17 + Spring Boot

REST API with layered architecture (controllers / services / repositories)

JPA entities with relational mappings

Environment-based configuration using Spring profiles

Frontend built with React + TypeScript

Deployed to production (alpha)

🚧 Public release planned soon

Source code is private. Architecture and implementation details can be discussed during interviews.
